However, Tessa manages to convince Sousuke of her chances with a daring strategy to beat Mao, which Sousuke readily approves of. Melissa waits impatiently for Tessa to arrive, and fashionably late, she arrives aboard the easier to operate M6 model, rather than the high-tech M9. With biased judges, a daring plan, and Mao’s overconfidence working in her favor, Tessa takes to the field and a fearsome duel begins."},{"SiteRating":9.3,"SiteRatingCount":4,"Id":430421,"EpisodeName":"Continuing Day by Day","AbsoluteNumber":49,"AiredEpisodeNumber":13,"AiredSeason":3,"LastUpdated":1341352845,"FirstAired":"2005-10-19T00:00:00","Overview":"Kaname makes a surprise visit to Sousuke in Hong Kong, and assists him in using the Arbalest's Lambda Driver to the fullest.

Alas, Kaname’s dreams of swimming, beaches, and summer romance have been dashed once again. Sousuke meets Shinji’s father, who is the ranking Secretary at the base. Shinji seems embarrassed, but Sousuke’s his usual military-minded self. Elsewhere, the girls are getting hit on by one of the soldiers from Nerima who came to compete in the AS competition against Narashino. Apparently Narashino’s AS unit is a joke, lacking any decent combat skills, and Nerima has defeated them soundly every year. Kaname turns the pilot’s offer to go AS down, and Mizuki rages over the fact he didn’t even notice her. \r\nThe gang watches from the crowd as Narashino gets creamed by Narima time and time again. Kazuma’s getting really aggravated by this and Sousuke decides that he can’t watch this folly any longer and intervenes personally. Kaname realizes Sousuke’s the one intervening and runs down and whacks the costumed Sergeant upside the head. While Kaname is yelling at Sousuke, Mizuki runs down and starts rubbing up against him wanting to play \"G.S.\" with him, but Kaname drags her off before she can take his mask off. Shinji’s dad, impressed by the masked Sousuke’s skill, begs Sousuke to take command of Narashino’s troops to lead them to victory against Nerima. Shinji is infuriated his father would lower himself to begging and storms off. Elsewhere, Narima is recruiting Kaname to join them in the final battle with Narashino, and the match is set for the final showdown."},{"SiteRating":9.0,"SiteRatingCount":3,"Id":299041,"EpisodeName":"Wind Rising in the Homeland (1)","AbsoluteNumber":15,"AiredEpisodeNumber":15,"AiredSeason":1,"LastUpdated":1302366446,"FirstAired":"2002-04-16T00:00:00","Overview":"Kaname’s finally getting her summer fun, but she doesn’t seem too thrilled about it. A few days prior, Mithril Intelligence obtained information that an arch nemesis Sousuke knows very well is alive and wandering the barren wastelands of Helmajistan. While Captain Testarossa is against the idea, Intelligence deploys Sousuke, along with a Mithril unit based in the Indian Ocean, to Helmajistan to assassinate this dangerous target. On the flight over, Sousuke gets heckled by some of his “comrades”, making it a very unpleasant flight for our young Sergeant. Eventually, the team arrives in theater and parachutes in country. \r\nBeing back in Helmajistan brings Sousuke’s memories of his days as a guerilla fighter there flooding back, but there’s no time for reminiscing, as their target and his convoy are within sight. Planning for their attack, Sousuke tries to voice his opinion, but is immediately rebuffed by his so-called allies, setting them up for disaster. Just as the ambush is about to commence, Sousuke tries desperately to convince them to cancel their attack, but some of the more hotheaded members aren’t interested and commence firing--throwing the whole situation into total disarray. While the Savages get dealt with fairly easily by the M9’s, the mysterious red AS takes out Batist’s M9, but to make matters incredibly worse for the Mithril force, Gauron and his fearsome Codarl AS have resurrected to join the party!"},{"SiteRating":9.0,"SiteRatingCount":3,"Id":299042,"EpisodeName":"Wind Rising in the Homeland (2)","AbsoluteNumber":16,"AiredEpisodeNumber":16,"AiredSeason":1,"LastUpdated":1302366461,"FirstAired":"2002-04-23T00:00:00","Overview":"The Mithril assault team finally begins to take Sousuke's advice into account, but it may be too late: Gauron has one of Sousuke's old comrades predicting what Sousuke will do."},{"SiteRating":9.0,"SiteRatingCount":3,"Id":299043,"EpisodeName":"Wind Rising in the Homeland (3)","AbsoluteNumber":17,"AiredEpisodeNumber":17,"AiredSeason":1,"LastUpdated":1302366478,"FirstAired":"2002-04-30T00:00:00","Overview":"Zaied outwits Sousuke's team and interdicts their advance!
